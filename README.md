This is a Stacked Autoencoder network that takes 3 multi-omic datasets, that is representative of patient samples (normal versus tumor) and builds a model that can help discover biomarkers that drive the tumors state. It also has a predictive model to predict based on three types of expression, whether they are normal or tumor samples.
